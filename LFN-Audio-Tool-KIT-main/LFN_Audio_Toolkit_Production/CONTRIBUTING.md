   - Expected benefits
   - Proposed implementation (optional)

### Code Contributions

#### Setup Development Environment
```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lfn-audio-toolkit.git
cd lfn-audio-toolkit

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
```

#### Making Changes
1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards:
   - Follow PEP 8 style guide
   - Add docstrings to functions and classes
   - Include type hints where appropriate
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages

3. Test your changes:
   ```bash
   python src/lfn_health_assessment.py
   # Run relevant analysis scripts to verify
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

5. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request:
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots if UI changes
   - Ensure all tests pass

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable names
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use f-strings for formatting

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to all functions:
  ```python
  def analyze_audio(file_path: str, use_gpu: bool = False) -> dict:
      """
      Analyze audio file for LFN and ultrasonic content.
      
      Args:
          file_path: Path to audio file
          use_gpu: Enable GPU acceleration
          
      Returns:
          Dictionary with analysis results
          
      Raises:
          FileNotFoundError: If audio file doesn't exist
      """
  ```

### Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- First line: brief summary (50 chars or less)
- Blank line, then detailed description if needed

Examples:
```
Add GPU acceleration support for batch processing

Implement CuPy-based FFT computation to speed up batch
analysis by 10x on CUDA-enabled systems.
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test on multiple audio file formats (WAV, FLAC, MP3)
- Verify output files are generated correctly
- Check error handling with invalid inputs

### Performance Testing
- Profile memory usage with large files
- Benchmark processing speed improvements
- Test GPU vs CPU performance

## 📚 Documentation

When adding new features:
- Update README.md
- Add examples to docs/
- Update command-line help text
- Include usage examples

## 🐛 Debugging

**Important:** Always follow the debugging workflow to fix root causes, not just symptoms. See [DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md) for comprehensive guidance.

### Key Debugging Principles

1. **Fix Root Causes, Not Symptoms**
   - Don't just make the error go away
   - Understand why it happened
   - Ensure it never happens again

2. **Follow the Systematic Process**
   - Reproduce reliably
   - Form hypotheses
   - Test methodically
   - Document findings

3. **Use the Right Tools**
   - Python debugger (pdb)
   - Memory profiling
   - Performance profiling
   - Logging and instrumentation

### Quick Debug Commands

```bash
# Check audio devices
python -c "import sounddevice as sd; print(sd.query_devices())"

# Test GPU availability
python -c "import cupy; print(cupy.cuda.runtime.runtimeGetVersion())"

# Verify dependencies
pip list | grep -E "soundfile|numpy|scipy|pandas"

# Run diagnostic
python preflight_check.py
```

### Debugging Workflow

When investigating an issue:

1. **Reproduce** - Create minimal test case
2. **Isolate** - Identify exact failure point
3. **Analyze** - Use the 5 Whys technique
4. **Fix** - Address root cause
5. **Verify** - Test thoroughly
6. **Document** - Update guides

See [DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md) for detailed examples, tools, and techniques.
